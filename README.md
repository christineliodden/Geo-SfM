### About Geo-SfM
[Geo-SfM](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-SfM/landing-page.html) is an open-source reference work for the acquisition, processing and analysis of structure-from-motion photogrammetry data in the geosciences.

The reference work was primarily developed as a class-room aid, but has since seen frequent use as a quick-guide for processing.
Best practices and tutorials are based on the experience acquired as part of the [Svalbox project](https://svalbox.no), which aims to digitize as many outcrops as possible in Svalbard (Norwegian Arctic).

### Project status
Geo-SfM is still in development, with additional tutorials and how-tos added continously to keep the work up-to-date with recent developments and evolving best practices.

### Contribute or improve the resource

### Acknowledgements and licensing
Geo-SfM is implemented through Jupyter Book and the Executable Book Project.
